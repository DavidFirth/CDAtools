# compos

An _R_ package for analysis of compositions through statistical models.  (Work in progress!)

This package supersedes an earlier package named `cglm` that was hosted on _Bitbucket_ --- a package that grew out of the PhD thesis work of Dr Fiona Sammut (PhD at Warwick; now working at the University of Malta).  The package's change of name was needed because the old name `cglm` has now been taken by a very different package on _CRAN_.
